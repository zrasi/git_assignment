# Git Assignment - <zrasi>
a. An issue in coding referes to a problem or bug that needs to be addressed to ensure the smooth functioning and quality of the software.

b. A pull request is a request asking others to review the changes we have made. First we make a copy of a repository to our own account (Forking), which allows us to make changes without affecting the original repository, then we create a new branch in the forked repository, so our changes won't affect the main branch and then we commit our changes, when satisfied with our changes we create a pull request.

c. To open up a pull request, we need to go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the tab Pull Request and then select the branch.

d. A step by step guide to add someone to your repository: Click on Settings>Collaborators>Enter password>Confirm>Add people>Search for people name and then Add.

e. difference between git and GitHub: git is a distributed version control system (VCS) and is used for tracking changes in source code, it allows several developers to work on the same project at the same time without affecting each other's work, and it operates locally on a developer's computer and there is no need to a network connection in order to function, meaning that developers can work offline and commit changes to their local repository. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories adds collaborational features on top of Git. It allows developers to store their Git repositories on GitHub servers remotely and share their code with others and collaborate with them on projects.

f. What git diff does is to show the differences between various states of a Git repository to review the changes made to the files in a project.

g. The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch? It is better not to push changes directly to the main branch. The best practice is to create a new branch from the main branch to work on our changes, and ensure that only tested and reviewed codes get integrated into the main branch eventually.
